    <h1 class="rule">Our Mission</h1>
    <br>
    <p class="rule">Pinball is intended to be a music platform for all users to share and enjoy music, whether it be released by a label, or an individual user. We take precaution in ensuring that our community gets the best out of their Pinball experience, and we have these guidelines to ensure that users, labels, & content creators are respected alike:</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="rule"><i class="twa twa-1x twa-clipboard"></i>Basic Etiquette</h3>
    <ul>
    <li class="rule">Please only post constructive comments, through any communication service provided on our platform.</li>
    <li class="rule">Please do not harass or be disrespectful to any individuals, groups, or labels. We have no tolerance for any users that set out for bullying people.</li>
    <li class="rule">Don’t impersonate labels, staff, or users. You may take the name of an artist, however you may not act as them on our platform.</li>
    <li class="rule">Please do not share other users’ personal information unless they explicitly post it themselves. We also recommend that artists do not give out their address or phone number, and keep it to the preset contact platforms on profiles. Distribution of these personal media cover all of our website.</li>
    <li class="rule">Please do not create novelty accounts for the purpose of a few times use, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersquatting">cyber squat</a> multiple names that won’t be used. If an artist requests an inactive account, an administrator may grant it to them.</li>
    <li class="rule">Do not post any hate speech or pornographic content.</li>
    </ul>
       
    <br>
    <h3 class="rule"><i class="twa twa-1x twa-clipboard"></i>Spam Prevention</h3>
    <p class="rule">Spamming is not tolerated on our service, and any accounts associated with spamming and/or unsolicited services will result in a termination. The act of spamming on our website is perceived as the following:</p>
       
       <ul>
           <li class="rule">Using a bot to perform any individual action on the site, such as likes/views.</li>
           <li class="rule">Driving traffic to non-affiliated sites with no relevance to our platform.</li>
           <li class="rule">Services that offer free or payment followers/likes/dislikes via our platform.</li>
           <li class="rule">Creating accounts for the sole purpose of boosting popularity of users.</li>
           <li class="rule">Posting multiple irrelevant comments to many tracks at a given time.</li>
       </ul> 
    
    <br>
    <h3 class="rule"><i class="twa twa-1x twa-clipboard"></i>Illegitimacy of Audience</h3>
    <p class="rule"> The audience, and the users of Pinball, are intended to be real people. Pinball tries to reach the demographic of users by providing the service, and all users are to be gaining their followers, likes, dislikes, and other forms of service legitimately. Any unfair advantages as above are not tolerated, and will result in termination. Some ways of reaching an audience are not allowed, however, and they are covered and defined by:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li class="rule">Advertising your own persona by using other users/labels/groups.</li>
            <li class="rule">Constantly following large amounts of accounts in a short span of time.</li>
            <li class="rule">Repeatedly repost and like tracks you already have in the past.</li>
            <li class="rule">Repeatedly follow and unfollow accounts to gain attention of your own.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br>
         <h3 class="rule"><i class="twa twa-1x twa-clipboard"></i>Using the Report System</h3>
         <p class="rule"> When reporting a track or user, you must state the rule they are breaking, and if there’s other accounts of the rule being broken, provide those separately. For certain violations, we encourage you to add evidence to the broken rule for investigation. This is so we can deal with the offense accordingly.</p>
         <br>
         <p class="rule"> When you report a track or user, it automatically goes to both the moderators and administrators of our service. We will deal with the track accordingly to see if it breaks any rules.</p>
         <br>
         <p class="rule"> Abuse of the report system will result in a punishment.</p>
         
         <br>
         <h3 class="rule"><i class="twa twa-1x twa-clipboard"></i>Types of Punishments</h3>
         <p class="rule"> Punishments are handed out to users that break the community guidelines. In order to keep our service in a good state, we will sometimes have to deal punishments to users of our service that don’t comply with them. The following punishments are in place, and will be on a case-by-case basis from the punishing staff member:</p>
         <ul>
             <li class="rule"><b>Warning</b> (You will receive a warning via your site mail on the offense, and a message from the moderator or administrator.)</li>
             <li class="rule"><b>Temporary Ban</b> (You will be restricted from our service temporarily until a specified date via an administrator or moderator.)</li>
             <li class="rule"><b>Termination</b> (You will be banned from the service. Evasion will result in a stronger website punishment. This can be appealed by contacting us detailing why you wish to appeal it.)</li>
             <li class="rule"><b>Shadowban</b> (You will be either temporarily banned or terminated, however you will not be informed about your punishment. You will not be aware of the active ban.)</li>
         </ul>
         <p class="rule"> Appeals should take from 1-3 weeks to process.</p>
         
         <br>
         <h3 class="rule"><i class="twa twa-1x twa-clipboard"></i>Suggesting a Guideline</h3><i class="twa-5x twa-clipboard"></i>
         <p class="rule">If you wish to bring up a guideline change that involves our service, you may contact us via our email in the footer. We request that you detail your experience, why you wish for this guideline to be implemented, and if there is anyone else who can vouch for the reason.
